It is a multi-purpose tool that is able to clean browser history, as well as the history of various Windows applications. The program runs on all popular Windows versions and it’s available in a large number of languages.Many similar applications are just useless programs, as they don’t really fix anything until you buy them. Even more, the errors they supposedly find are not even real. I am always a bit reserved when I test such a program. And I must say that JetClean impressed me in a very pleasant way. I personally verified if the found registry errors, as well as other problems, were real. JetClean proved to be an efficient solution for increasing the performance of my PC, not just another scam.Its graphical user-interface is well designed. By clicking on one of the three tabs on the main window, you get access to the scanning section, program tool or settings.Another thing I appreciated is the scanning speed provided by JetClean. In less than a minute, it was able to scan and fix the found errors (yes, the trial version of the program is able to do that).",

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

While this may at first seem tedious and unintuitive, it is remarkably powerful and is a very good way to manage projects in a precise, consistent, and reproducible manner. Because text-based scripts are human readable, projects are inherently self-documenting. The scripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex filters can be created from basic operations to develop a sophisticated palette of useful and unique effects.",
